IVN Publish is a plugin for publishing posts from your WordPress site into the IVN news feed.


== Description ==

IVN Publish is a plugin for simultaneously publishing posts from your WordPress site into the IVN
news feed. IVN Publish plugin was also designed to publish to a unique column, also hosted on IVN.us. 
Publishing an IVN column makes it easy for a large network of readers to view and receive updates from you or your organization. 
This encourages further engagement in your local website and expands exposure outside of core followers.

**Etiquette**

All content publish to IVN must abide by the *four etiquette guidelines*:

1. No Personal Attacks - Attack the argument, not the person.
2. No Self-Promotion - This news platform is for discussing issues.  You may purchase an advertisement for promotional purposes.
3. No Partisan-Based Attacks - Just because someone else said it does not mean its true.  The gossip stops here.
4. Claims Must be Substantiated - If your sentence starts with “Democrats think…” or “All Republicans are…” your article will be rejected.

If content submitted through the plugin does not meet these standards it will not be published on IVN. IVN editors will work with you to ensure all content abides by the etiquette.
